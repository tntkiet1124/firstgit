                <p>In June 2009, Epps was selected as an astronaut candidate[1] for the 20th class of NASA astronauts and later qualified in 2011.[14][4] Her training included extensive Russian, spacewalk (EVA) and robotics training, along with geology.[4] She has also completed T-38 jet training and has attended the National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS).[4]

                    Epps subsequently served as an aquanaut aboard the Aquarius underwater laboratory during the NEEMO 18 undersea exploration mission for nine days starting July 21, 2014.[8][7] She has also participated in geologic studies in Hawaii.[4] Epps has worked with the Generic Joint Operation Panel as a representative, which included work on crew efficiency on the ISS.[4] This work resulted in the Johnson Space Center Director's Innovation Group Achievement Award in 2013.[4] She has also worked as CAPCOM for Mission Control, including serving as lead CAPCOM, and currently serves in ISS Operations Branch.[5][4] Epps has also completed training in winter and water survival in Star City, Russia.[6]
                    
                    On January 4, 2017, NASA announced that Epps would be assigned as a flight engineer to the International Space Station in mid-2018 for Expeditions 56 and 57, becoming the first African American space station crew member,[21] the first African American to launch aboard the Russian Soyuz vehicle,[22] and the 15th African American to fly in space,[23] but on January 16, 2018, NASA announced that Epps had been replaced by her backup Serena M. Auñón-Chancellor, but that Epps would "be considered for assignment to future missions".[24] The reason for Epps' removal was not stated, and a NASA spokesperson said, "These decisions are personnel matters for which NASA doesn't provide information."[25] The Washington Post stated that "Last-minute crew changes are not unusual at NASA."[23][26][27]
                    
                    In 2019, Epps completed the ESA CAVES training program simulating the demands of exploring unknown terrains, such as to be expected on the Moon and Mars.[9][6][10][28] Epps is the second woman to participate in CAVES, following fellow NASA astronaut, Jessica Meir.[29][30][6][9][10]
                    
                    Epps also participates in public speaking and she has been a guest speaker at the University of Maryland multiple times.[15][16][31] In 2013, she gave the commencement speech for the A. James Clark School of Engineering's Winter Commencement Ceremony.[32]
                    
                    She is currently a Member of the Society for Science & the Public, in addition to the AIAA.[4]</p>
